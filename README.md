# forum_posting_bot
This is a bot that posts on etxa.com.
Uses selenium to login and post. Will allow for a user to enter in their own account information to post with. Working on making it an executable and incorporating https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn to generate the titles and bodies of questions. 

I encourage whoever downloads this to add questions to the document here -> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T_ygbMHKeC8tPf0xJwMaOu811D5OC6AvvI80w7f3JeM/edit?usp=sharing
